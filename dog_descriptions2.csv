 Did I catch your eye? I don't blame you if you had to stop and stare, I am quite cute if I do say so myself.  I'm Ziggy and I think you look like a wonderful choice for my forever friend! I don't give my heart away at the drop of a hat, but if you will give me some time and space to settle in and adjust to my new life, we can be buddies. Once I'm comfortable, I love to go on walks, play, and spend time curled up with my best friends. 
Ziggy is shy  until he knows you and feels safe. He was found as a stray so we have no history on him. He is learning to trust, loves being petted and having belly rubs. He will follow you around the yard. He knows sit and is learning to walk on a leash. He is unsure about what toys are for but shows interest in them.
Beautiful colors in his brindle coat.

The family that surrendered him to the shelter said he was 10 yrs old, but we and our vet think he is younger. Hearts Alive Rescue has him now and we think he is very very special! He lived with other big dogs, cats, and children from babies to teenagers before. His old family filled out a paper and they describe him as smart and enthusiastic. He knows his basic commands: sit, stay, down, and come and he always let them know when he had to go potty outside. His previous family say he hides during storms and fireworks but loves his people so much and is very sweet and loyal. Butch caught a bad cold at the shelter and is being treated, but feeling so much better already. He is neutered, up to date on vaccines, and has a microchip.

If youÃ¢Â€Â™re a big dog I will follow you, personal space, whatÃ¢Â€Â™s that? I have two big foster brothers and IÃ¢Â€Â™m learning the ropes from them and follow them around. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve got lots of energy... I love to run around and play. My sister has been with me too and I donÃ¢Â€Â™t think we know how to sit still. ??

I do like my food bowl separate from others for now.  Bones and treats, yes please! I love giving kisses, I can be a bit strong with them, so fair warning. I like an assertive figure that will tell me NO and shows me IÃ¢Â€Â™m not the boss. I am only 6 mos old afterall!!  I survived the Korean meat trade so I am behind on my puppy training. ?

I really want an active home with another large breed playful pup to be my best friend. ??

I enjoy my crate I go in it pretty easily on my own and I havenÃ¢Â€Â™t had any accidents.  I will bark if I hear a noise during the night but if itÃ¢Â€Â™s nothing I go right back to sleep. IÃ¢Â€Â™m also really great on car rides. 

Some things still make me a little nervous out in the world as things are still a little new to me, but If you show me itÃ¢Â€Â™s ok, I relax pretty quick. I know IÃ¢Â€Â™m a good boy and I know I have lots of love in me for whoever I pick to adopt me!!!  So please have lots of love time and energy for me. I deserve a forever home after all I have been through. ????

Ella is a gorgeous girl who is 
happy, affectionate and good with other dogs. Sweet and full of personality, she just lo-o-o-o-ves people.  If youÃ¢Â€Â™re looking for a pooch that will stick to you like glue Ella would be your gal!
Ella is a young dog who's fallen on hard times but her gentle, nurturing soul still shines through. Ideal for a family with well behaved children, she'd be the perfect companion for a family who wants a quiet, friendly pet with good house manners. Ella is 14 pounds and 1 and half years old. She was rescued from our local shelter due to a cloudy eye- as of now we are trying to save her eye. We are doing two drops every 8 hours- we will soon know if her eye needs removed. She is housebroken, crate trained, good with other dogs her size, loves a walk, great in the car and extremely sweet.  Ahome4spot call Mandi 702-321-0578

She definitely loves to be around people. Carmen loves to go for walks and runs around the neighborhood. She also doesn't mind to just relax on the couch next to you. Carmen loves blankets that she can lay on just the way she likes. She is not a fan of being in a cage at all. She sleeps on the couch instead, but would probably prefer to be in your bed. This is what her foster has learned about her so far! Come see for yourself all this cute girl has to offer! More will be known about me soon.   

A Path 4 Paws holds adoption events EVERY Saturday & Sunday from 10am-4pm at C-A-L Ranch,  located at 232 N. Jones Blvd right off the I-95.   Please bring your dog(s) for a meet and greet (if applicable)

If you are interested in Carmen, please contact dogrescuelv@hotmail.com to confirm the dog you are interested in,  will be attending that particular weekend.  We have limited space at the store, therefore we can not take every dog out to the event.

Carmen is spayed/neutered, has current vaccinations and includes a microchip, deworming and 2 free vet visits.  Adoption fee applies.  Please make sure you have read the information listed on the homepage for requirements and restrictions. 

Foster homes & volunteers are always needed.  Please contact us regarding how you can help by fostering or volunteering for our organization."

The good Sam did the right thing and had Animal Control come pick him up so his family would have a chance to find him. She then contacted us, letting us know what a great dog he was, after having spent only 7 hours with this dirty, matted, skinny boy. We wanted to help, so we requested him from the shelter. The day before we were supposed to pick him up, he was reclaimed, only to be returned to the shelter the next day. So we contacted the shelter, letting them know we still wanted to save him. (He had been put on the transfer list for being scared the first time he got to the shelter.) He was definitely confused about what was going on, but didnÃ¢Â€Â™t hesitate when I opened the back of my car, and he flew in! By the time we got to the vet clinic he was happy, wagging his tail, asking for attention and affection. He is getting all cleaned up and we are getting to know him a little better.

A adorable Pom/Chi 
A absolute sweetheart of a boy Simba is affectionate and quiet.   He is looking for a fairly quiet home where he can get daily walks and where he can be allowed to live inside as a close member of the family. He has basic obedience and is very well behaved.  He is 4 years old and 8 pounds. He is crate trained and gets along well with other dogs his size.  He does enjoy to play with them.  Mature children is a must with a secure yard.

I was recently surrendered to A Home 4 Spot after my owner realized she didnÃ¢Â€Â™t have the skills to handle me. 
After going through a lot of hard work and training to be a service dog, it didnÃ¢Â€Â™t work out for me. I was heavily drugged, put in a crate, lived in a prong collar and received zero exercise or down time. 
I love people of all sizes. However, due to my energy level, no small kids please. 
The same goes for dogs. I love them all, but IÃ¢Â€Â™ve got too much energy for smaller dogs. IÃ¢Â€Â™ve also lived with cats. 
I need a German Shepherd experienced owner. My new owners need to follow up with my trainer.  No apartments or condos.
If interested in meeting me, contact my foster mom. Genie Joyce 317/701-6196
