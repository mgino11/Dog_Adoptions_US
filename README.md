Pet Adoption Analysis

When looking to add a new fury friend to the Family the thought of “Adopting” instead of buying is encouraged. However, in order to find a good fit for a home, the new pet owner needs to consider some aspects about the animal before the adoption process.
Where are they coming from?, vaccinated?, have they been in a special needs home before?are they house trained?

Problem Statement

I would like to analyze the information that is available to future pet owners that are opting for adoption instead of purchase. In addition, i would like to determine in which state are adoption pets more abundant and how breeds are represented in numbers compared to others.
